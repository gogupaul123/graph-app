I started pretty slowly, wasting the first few hours trying to fetch the information from https://fakerql.stephix.uk/ simply because this was my first time working with a GraphQL API.

After I finally managed to do that, I had to think about how I should tackle the project. I quickly figured out that the data I got from the API(the date every post was created at) was in milliseconds, so I googled it and found a function that translates them into actual dates.

From there on, things went pretty smoothly with the VX package. By reading the default graph code 10 times I learned just enough to apply it on my own data. Next was some CSS finesse all around the project and the PARTICLES npm package and that was pretty much it.
